print("""The Basics of Programming 

With your partner, determine a name for your programming language. Draft out the syntax for your language for the standard concepts seen in all programming languages (like how to assign variables, perform operators, flow control, etc). Draft up two sample programs; first a Hello World program, and second a more complex program that includes variables, operators, and flow control.

Heavily inspired by Javascript

document.write('Hello, World!');
