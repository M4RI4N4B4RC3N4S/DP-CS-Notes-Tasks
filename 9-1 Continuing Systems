-BigBang/Direct/Immediate:One system is entirely discontinued and the other is brought online. This method is less taxing.Requires frontloading training prior to the changeover.
-Pilot: Common with bigger organizations that have multiple sites. This allows the company to to test out the new system and fix issues without taking on such a great risk. Once they believe it is successful enough to implement it to their other sites they are able to use the pilot group as a model.
- Phased: When the new system is implemented in phases. Usually means that the systems have to be alike to facilitate the transition of date from one system to another. Training is extended and take a long time to completely phased out. The phases can be based on certain proccesses, functions, or departments."""
